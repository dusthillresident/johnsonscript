# JohnsonScript
JohnsonScript is a simple programming language with graphics features implemented via Xlib.
Available as an interpreter written in C, and as a trans-compiler that generates C code.

To build/compile, you need to be sure the package 'libxext-dev' is installed. \
Make "compile.sh" executable and run it. You must first cd to the johnsonscript source directory otherwise it won't work. 

It's designed for linux with X windows but it can work on windows with cygwin/x.

# Try it out

Download the source archive,\
extract it,\
run compile.sh,\
then try this command:\
./gfxbin example_programs/graphical/craigdavid
